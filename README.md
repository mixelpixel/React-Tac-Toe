    Creating a new React app in /Users/mixelpix/JavaScript/React-Tac-Toe/my-app.

    Installing packages. This might take a couple minutes.
    Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts...

    + react@15.6.1
    + react-dom@15.6.1
    + react-scripts@1.0.10
    added 1204 packages in 70.091s

    Success! Created my-app at /Users/mixelpix/JavaScript/React-Tac-Toe/my-app
    Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

      npm start
        Starts the development server.

      npm run build
        Bundles the app into static files for production.

      npm test
        Starts the test runner.

      npm run eject
        Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
        and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

    We suggest that you begin by typing:

      cd my-app
      npm start

    Happy hacking!

  03 $  cd my-app
  04 $  npm start
    > my-app@0.1.0 start /Users/mixelpix/JavaScript/React-Tac-Toe/my-app
    > react-scripts start


    Starting the development server...
    Compiled successfully!

    You can now view my-app in the browser.

      Local:            http://localhost:3000/
      On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.106:3000/

    Note that the development build is not optimized.
    To create a production build, use npm run build.
